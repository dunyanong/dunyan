Established in 1999, the Nanyang Technological University Investment Interactive Club (NTU-IIC) is the oldest and most established student-led finance society in Singapore. With more than 20 years of esteemed history, NTU-IIC has continued to serve as the dominant platform for the finance industry to connect with secondary and tertiary education students across Singapore.

## My Thoughts
I have to say, among all the clubs and societies I've been part of, this has probably been one of the most fast-paced and high-pressure experiences. Although it’s not directly related to robotics or engineering, I found it very useful to learn more about finance and to connect with people from the finance industry. It’s also a great way to broaden my financial knowledge and strengthen my soft skills by interacting with non-technical individuals.

## National Cashflow Competition
The National Cashflow Competition (NCF) is a nationwide, non-profit event designed to promote financial literacy in an engaging way, using a board game format to simulate real-world financial decision-making. Participants compete against their peers while gaining insights into the financial landscape of Singapore.

I had the privilege of serving as Co-Chairperson for NCF2025, where we successfully attracted over 500 participants from across the country.

The Closing Ceremony was graced by distinguished guests from the CDC, ISCA, ACCA, and Dr. Sarjit. Fun fact: the person in the bottom right of the photo is Victor, my partner-in-crime throughout the entire journey.
