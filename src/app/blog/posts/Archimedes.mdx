We are a dynamic team of undergraduate innovators from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, dedicated to pioneering the autonomous systems of the future. Our focus is on designing and building cutting-edge Autonomous Maritime Systems (AMS), which seamlessly integrate Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs). These advanced systems are capable of navigating on water surfaces and executing a variety of tasks entirely autonomously, without the need for human intervention.
