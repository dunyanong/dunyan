## My Thoughts

Hackathons are something I always look forward to. It's tiring for sure — sometimes 24 hours straight, no proper sleep, just coding and surviving on kopi and snacks. But the experience? Very worth it.

Every hackathon pushes me to think fast, work with people from different backgrounds, and build something from scratch under pressure. Win or lose, I always learn something new — whether it’s a new framework, a better way to collaborate, or just how to present an idea clearly.

Here are some notable hacks I have joined! (Can't put too much cuz I am lazy)

### 📌 Hack: RHB Hack 2023
My first hackathon during Jan 2023, a period during my completion my high school. We built **Zee**, an expense tracking feature with a Tinder-style swipe interface to help users categorise spending quickly. It gives weekly feedback based on their choices to build better awareness around money habits.

> _“Spend mindfully, even when you’re not thinking clearly.”_

Javascript, Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI

Didn’t make the Top 10 (out of 100 teams), but it was a great learning experience. Got mentored by [Khairul Nazran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/knazran/), one of Malaysia’s top hackathon veteran. Proud of what we managed to ship in just one day.


### 📌 Hack: Startathon 23/24 Garage@EEE
My team and I developed a prototype of a crop tracking system designed to monitor crop health and support farmers in securing funding from SMEs and VCs. Won 1st place!

The system was built using an ESP32 microcontroller integrated with light (lux), soil moisture, and temperature sensors, with data stored and synced via Firebase. The frontend interface was developed entirely using JavaScript and React.

### 📌 Hack: Sunway Make it Challenge by Solana
Top 8 Winner — My first blockchain hackathon! Despite having limited Web3 experience, I thoroughly enjoyed learning from my teammates who were well-versed in the industry.

Proud to have collaborated with my friend [Xue Rui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wangxuerui2003/). 💡
