URECA acronym of Undergraduate Research Experience on CAmpus, is a university wide undergraduate research programme established in 2004 to cultivate a research culture and nurture research capabilities early in undergraduatesâ€™ university education.

In this programme undergraduates will gain invaluable hands-on research experience under the mentorship of faculty of their choice in their chosen field of research over a period of 11 months (August to June). The foundations of research experience and practical skills gained through URECA prepares undergraduates for postgraduate research studies or career in research.
