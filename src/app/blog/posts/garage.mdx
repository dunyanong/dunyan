Garage@EEE is a student-led maker space in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering. We provide the environment, materials, and funding for students to develop their ideas, alongside their technical skills. Furthermore, we run creative initiatives to provide opportunities for our ambassadors to enhance other holistic skills. Aided by our strong industry connections and extensive alumni network, Garage@EEE creates not only engineers of today, but thinkers, entrepreneurs, and world leaders of tomorrow. 

## My Thoughts
Garage@EEE was honestly one of the best parts of my NTU journey. It's a makerspace where we’re free to build, tinker, and explore whatever ideas we have — from electronics to software, no limits.

I joined as part of the Training and Development Committee. Got to project with printed circuit boards, 3D printers, Raspberry Pi, ESP32, Arduino — you name it. I also had the chance to run projectshops and teach ReactJS, NodeJS, and JavaScript to IEM and CS students. It was super rewarding to share what I knew and learn alongside others.

## Startathon
STARTathon is where things get exciting. It’s a chance for Garage members to come together, think big, and build a projecting prototype that solves a real-world problem. At the end, we pitch our ideas to a panel of judges. The top teams get funding — and if you're lucky, a spot in the Innovator’s Track.

My team and I developed a prototype of a crop tracking system designed to monitor crop health and support farmers in securing funding from SMEs and VCs. Won 1st place!

The system was built using an ESP32 microcontroller integrated with light (lux), soil moisture, and temperature sensors, with data stored and synced via Firebase. The frontend interface was developed entirely using JavaScript and React.

## Escendo
Escendo is another flagship event, focused more on design thinking and innovation within a specific theme. Participants form teams, build prototypes, and pitch to judges. It's a great opportunity to pick up technical and creative skills, and also connect with people from the industry. Real hands-on, real impactful.
